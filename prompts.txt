# Simple UX eval
i'm trying to enhance the user experience, particularly for an inexperienced
user who isn't tech-savvy. the app is currently running on a device which you
can access at http://0646e024-porttracker-sdr.local/ . it's a fresh install with
an empty config. can you have a look and make some suggestions on how to
streamline the experience? particularly with what might confuse inexperienced
users.


# UX eval with hotspot
The purpose of the software we're building here is to manage a device used to
receive AIS data from a software defined radio (SDR). It needs to be able to run
on headless devices, providing its web interface for configuration. The process
of setting it up should be accessible even to inexperienced, non-technical
users.

I want to run a usability study of the initial setup. I have a Raspberry Pi 4
with an SDR USB stick that's running a fresh install of the software. There is
no monitor or keyboard connected to it. You assume the role of a non-technical
with the following goals:
- Access the device to connect it to a WiFi network known to you
- Get access to the management interface of the device
- Do whatever initial setup is required to get the device running
- Set the device up to receive AIS messages

You're aware that the device is supposed to open an access point to which you
can connect to in order to give it a WiFi connection. Once connected to the
access point, you're supposed to navigate to any page in your browser, e.g.
http://asdf

A few technical notes for the study:
- I will make sure this machine is connected to the access point.
- Connect to the Wifi SSID named dddsfbga, the password is haahaaweeeeh
- After providing the SSID and password, you will be informed that your
  machine should connect to the same SSID (dddsfbga in our case). I will make
  sure that is the case.
- You will be asked to provide a name and position (latitude and longitude, as
  well as altitude) for the device. You can use any name you like and any
  position and altitude with valid values.

While carrying out this study, please create a markdown file in which you make
notes of possible improvements to the user experience. Pay particular attention
to things that might confuse inexperienced users.

- Do whatever initial setup is required to get the device running
- Set the device up to receive AIS messages (there is not antenna attached, so
  nothing will actually be received, but the device should be configured so that
  it should work)

You will be asked to provide a name and position (latitude and longitude, as
well as altitude) for the device. You can use any name you like and any
position and altitude with valid values.
